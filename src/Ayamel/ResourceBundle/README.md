# AyamelResourceBundle #

This bundle defines the base Resource objects and provides MongoDB mappings for data persistence, as well as custom repository classes
for common operations.  It also maps the models for JMS Serialization, and validation.  There is some custom validation implemented for `FileReference` and `Relation` documents.

It also provides a pluggable mechanism for deriving resource documents from URIs.
